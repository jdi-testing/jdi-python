# JDI 2.0
Powerful Framework for UI Automation Testing on Python

## Getting started
Before you begin:
- Python 3.11 is used for this project. To install Python on MacOs you can use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), on Windows you can use [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/).
- run git clone https://github.com/jdi-testing/jdi-python.git or fork the repository and clone it afterwards.
- create a virtual environment for the project. You can use [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) or [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) for that.
- set up Python interpreter to use Python 3.11 in your IDE.
- run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all required dependencies.

## You can simply run tests to see how it works
1. inside your IDE
2. using pytest
 - activate your virtual environment by running `source venv/bin/activate` on MacOs or `venv\Scripts\activate` on Windows
 - run `pytest` in the terminal
